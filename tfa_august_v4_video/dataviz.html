							The workshop prepared by our teachers was all about data. How to represent data in the way it makes sense. By showing it on a poster and a website at the same time.

						<h1>The searching process</h1>
						<h2>a long and tedious one</h2>

						<p>	
							Our first task was to find a rich and a meaningful database.
							Since we were not finding any viable information about music, we tried something else.
							We created a form to be filled in by the students of our school. This table was a fail-safe in case we did not find the data we were looking for.

							After two days of exploration on the web we finally found the support of our project : a big database containing 17000 songs with a ton of information about each of them.
							We needed to roam around the database to find interesting correlations.
							We found four different ones :

							We had the content, but no idea of how to represent it. So we started focusing on the visual part of our work. We made a lot of diferent versions before we were happy.

						<h1>Static side of the...</h1>
						<h2>because websites are not the only way</h2>

						<p>
							First thing we designed was the poster, it seemed to be the most logical order. By creating the poster we we're as well thinking about how we were going to be able to generate it with code. Whit this in the back of our heads we created an intricate graph, that we new could be generated on the website.
							We chose blue for the digital aspect of todays music storage. As well the background is dark, so the graph will realy pop out and be right in the face.

						<h1>Dynamic side of the...</h1>
						<h2>coding with a new library, INTERESTING !</h2>

						<p>
							Since we already designed the graph on our poster, the logical thing to do next was to code it into a website. We used « d3.js », it was a steap learning curve, but we did it. Finaly we added two more simple graphs, because we still had two more corelations we found in the databass. The website is based on the same colors as the poster but the background has turned in a more flashy and bright blue.

								<h2>data fetching</h2>

								<p>
									I helped searching for a viable database. When we found it, it was so big we had to sort the data and transfer only what we needed of the database, that was my job.
									
								</p>
							</div>

							<div class="text noshadow">
								<h2>data matching</h2>

								<p>
									When we got all the data we wanted into a clean spreadcheat, I started playing with the data. Looking for interesting things to compare, like the evolution of music styles during the years.
									
								</p>
							</div>

							<div class="text noshadow">
								<h2>poster designing</h2>

								<p>
									When I finished matching up data, 2 persons started designing the poster and the other one studying d3.js.  At first I helped for the poster, I gave my opinion and created a prototype myself.
									
								</p>
							</div>

							<div class="text noshadow">
								<h2>website designing</h2>

								<p>
									After the poster, I got into the website part. I designed and coded a little idea I had for the website but it would turn out to complicated to implement d3.js in it.
									
								</p>
							</div>

							<div class="text noshadow">
								<h2>multidisciplinary</h2>

								<p>
									Finally I helped a bit on the poster and a bit on the website. I helped for the color choices of the poster and I created the credits page of the website.

						<h1>a great experience</h1>
						<h2>bit slow at the start but realy educational</h2>

						<p>	
							This workshop realy let me do what I like, meaning the different aspects of web: Designing, developing, experimenting, searching and coming together with people. As every workshop I did during this year, I learned something new and had a real good time practicing my web skills.
